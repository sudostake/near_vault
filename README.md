## How to Build Locally?
See [NEAR docs](https://docs.near.org/smart-contracts/quickstart) for more details.

```zsh
# Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Contracts will be compiled to wasm, so we need to add the wasm target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install NEAR CLI-RS to deploy and interact with the contract
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/releases/latest/download/near-cli-rs-installer.sh | sh

# Install cargo near to help building the contract
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/near/cargo-near/releases/latest/download/cargo-near-installer.sh | sh
```

```bash
cargo near build
```

## How to Test Locally?

```bash
cargo test
```

## How to Deploy?

Deployment is automated with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
To deploy manually, install [`cargo-near`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) and run:

```bash
cargo near deploy build-reproducible-wasm <account-id>
```
